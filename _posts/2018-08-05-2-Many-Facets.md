title: 2 Many Facets 
---

*I decided to start a blog. Here is why...*

Those who know me well are aware that (as many people in academy nowadays), I'm
doing a lot of stuff that is not reflected in [traditional academic
publications](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=YaOdoooAAAAJ&hl=fr).  In
addition to my research in combinatorial optimization and my teaching
activities, I also spend a lot of time developing web applications for
[EURO](https://www.euro-online.org) and most notably the [abstract submission
system](https://www.euro-online.org/conf/)  used for EURO,
[IFORS](http://www.ifors.org) and  [GOR](http://www.gor-ev.de/)
conferences for more than 13 years. I am also an open-source software
enthusiast and always interested in learning new tools (recently a lot into
[clojure](https://www.clojure.org) and [NixOS](https://www.nixos.org)). On my
spare time, I'm also a [DJ and mashup
producer](https://www.facebook.com/krazyben/).

So, there are many facets to my life, but most of these remain largely
undocumented and I don't share much about them, or in a very fragmented way.
Even for myself, I sometimes loose track of how (and why) I did some stuff.
Therefore, here we are. I will use this blog as a central place to document
what I'm doing, hoping some of it will be useful for some other people. I've
been thinking about this for a few months now, and my colleague
[Guillerme](https://twitter.com/gduvillie) pushed me in that direction a few
weeks ago when we talked about some [recent
contributions](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/44029) I made to NixOS
*«You should start a blog to share this stuff»*. 

Here we are then!  This blog is a new experience for me, and I still don't know
how regularly I will post here.

Back to the abstract submission system, it should definitely become open-source
to make it sustainable in the long term, but it needs a lot of refactoring and improvements.
This blog will be a central place where I will share about this process.

Moreover, I'm currently busy with the organization of the [Operations Research
2018](https://www.or2018.be) (come and visit us in Brussels, registration is
open until the end of August :smile:). The current [program
page](https://www.euro-online.org/conf/or2018/program) is quite heavy to load
and not very mobile friendly. In addition, we also need to clean up the
database of EURO users (hello GDPR) but this necessitates to re-think how to
exploit correctly the archive of conference programs we have since 2005. Hence,
the development of new tools to browse conference programs is something I will
work on in the coming months. By documenting the developments here, I hope to
get some feedback, but also that it could be useful to other developers.

I will also talk here about operations research, optimization, music, and
the many other facets of my life.

Welcome to this journey, I hope you'll enjoy it,
and I look forward to your comments and suggestions. Don't hesitate to contact
me [by email](mailto:bernard.fortz@gmail.com), on
[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/djkrazyben) or by leaving comments here.
