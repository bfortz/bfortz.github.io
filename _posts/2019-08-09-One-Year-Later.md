*I started a blog one year ago, then kind of let it die. But it was only sleeping, here is an update about the many things that happened during this year.* 

So last year I started this blog, and one of my objectives was to use it to share and somehow document the many things I'm doing that are not visible through classical academic publications. Among others, I started to document the new app I developed for the [Operations Research 2018 conference](https://www.or2018.be) I organized in Brussels. The export of data was quite well documented in the two blog posts on the subject, but I should find time to document the most important part, the web app itself. The code is [available here](https://github.com/bfortz/euro-program-app) and has evolved a lot during the year. It was improved a lot, and the data of all previous conferences that used the EURO Conference System was imported into it, so you can now browse the [full history of conferences since 2005](https://www.euro-online.org/conferences/program/). It was also used successfully during the [EURO 2019 conference](https://www.euro2019dublin.com/) conference in Dublin.

Unfortunately, the life of the blog almost stopped there for a while. The organization of the conference ate my time until the end of September, and I never took the time and discipline to write regularly. I think Mike Trick [knows what I'm talking about](https://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/blog/index.php/2015/07/19/state-of-operations-research-blogging/). Despite this, I think blogging still has some advantages over a social-media only strategy, so I'm not giving up.

In this post, I will make a brief summary of things that happened since last year, and I hope to have the discipline to come with more frequent updates as we move in the next academic year.

# Operations Research 2018

The conference was a real success, as an organizer I did not get into any major problem. The staff at [MCE](https://mce.eu/) was very efficient and the feedback of participants was awesome. In addition to the excellent scientific program, the highlight of the conference was without any doubt the conference dinner at the Belgian Comic Strip Centre, followed by a memorable party with three "surprise" DJs...

# Other EURO-related stuff

2019 marks a big jump in my activities with EURO, as I have my own company now. Just me for the time being, but I plan to expand. On the web development side, apart from the app, we are currently trying to clean up the members database and to comply more closely to GDPR. Also, we started a joint wordpress platform for the working groups, but the experience is far from a success and we are in the process of designing new tools for working groups membership management and to set up a new platform for their websites. I'll probably blog about this in the coming weeks.

# Research

A bit of a transition year, I'm still working on some bilevel optimization
applied to [security
games](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037722171930414X) and
electricity markets (paper under preparation). I also went back to optimization
in telecommunications, working on optimization models for the emerging
technology on [](segment routing). I'll talk about this at [Operations Research
2019](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/or2019) in Dresden and at the [2019 INFORMS
Annual Meeting](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/seattle2019/) in
Seattle. The collaboration with [the INOCS team](https://team.inria.fr/inocs/)
at INRIA Lille Nord-Europe also intensified as I spent more time there over the
last year.

# Music

Apart from the great party at OR2018, I was not very active on the DJing / producing music front, but during this summer holiday, I started producing mashups again after a long break of almost three years.

The first one puts the voice of Freddy Mercury on the music of Depeche Mode. Although looking like a simple A+B, it involved pitching the voice Freddy up and reworking the structure of Personal Jesus to match the harmonics of Radio Gaga.

The second one marks the 30th anniversary of the release of Pump Up The Jam by Technotronic, that I mixed with a lot of other sources.

I also joined the board of Panama, the association in charge of the concert venue [Belvédère](https://www.belvedere-namur.be/) in Namur, so more musical events expected in the coming months!

I'll try not to wait another year to keep you updated, thanks for reading!
