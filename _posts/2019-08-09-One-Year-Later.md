*I started a blog one year ago, then kind of let it die. But it was only sleeping, here is an update about the many things that happened during this year.* 

So last year I started this blog, and one of my objectives was to use it to share and somehow document the many things I'm doing that are not visible through classical academic publications. Among others, I started to document the new app I developed for the *Operations Research 2018* conference I organized in Brussels. The export of data was quite well documented in the two blog posts on the subject, but I should find time to document the most important part, the web app itself. The code is [available here](https://github.com/bfortz/euro-program-app) and has evolved a lot during the year. It was improved a lot, and the data of all previous conferences that used the EURO Conference System was imported into it, so you can now browse the [full history of conferences since 2005](https://www.euro-online.org/conferences/program/). It was also used successfully during the EURO 2019 conference in Dublin.

What else happened since last year?

# Operations Research 2018

The conference was a real success, as an organizer I did not get into any major problem. The staff at [MCE](https://mce.eu/) was very efficient and the feedback of participants was awesome. In addition to the excellent scientific program, the highlight of the conference was without any doubt the conference dinner at the Belgian Comic Strip Centre, followed by a memorable party with three "surprise" DJs...
