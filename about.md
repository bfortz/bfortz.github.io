I am Bernard Fortz, professor in the [Graphs and Mathematical
Optimization](https://gom.ulb.ac.be/) group in the [Computer Science
Department](http://www.ulb.ac.be/facs/sciences/info/) of  [Universit√© libre the Bruxelles (ULB)](https://www.ulb.ac.be).

My main [research
activities](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=YaOdoooAAAAJ) are in
combinatorial optimization, and in particular applications in networks
(telecommunications, energy, ...) and decomposition methods for large-scale
models and bilevel optimization.

I'm also involved in [EURO](https://www.euro-online.org), the Association of European Operational Research Societies, where I'm responsible of the website development and the abstract submission platform for [EURO conferences](https://www.euro-online.org/web/pages/100/conferences).

Over the last few years, I developed a strong interest in functional programming, and in particular [clojure](https://www.clojure.org). I also contributed recently to some [NixOS](https://www.nixos.org) packages.

When I find some time, I'm also a [DJ and mashup producer](https://www.facebook.com/krazyben/).

Most importantly, I'm a husband and father of 5 wonderful kids...
